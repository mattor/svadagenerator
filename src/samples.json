        "text": "To be, or not to be: that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; no more; and, by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. There's the respect that makes calamity of so long a life; for who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, the insolence of office, and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something after death, the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will, and makes us rather bear those ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of? Thus consience doth make cowards of us all; and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action."

        "text": "Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders. (\"What does 'under the name' mean?\" asked Christopher Robin. \"It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it.\" \"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Now I am,\" said a growly voice. \"Then I will go on,\" said I.) One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise. Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think. First of all he said to himself: \"That buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee.\" Then he thought another long time, and said: \"And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey.\" And then he got up, and said: \"And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.\" So he began to climb the tree. He climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself. It went like this: Isn't is funny how a bear likes honey? Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! I wonder why he does?"

Aber der TÃ¼rhÃ¼ter sagt, daÃŸ er ihm jetzt den Eintritt nicht gewÃ¤hren kÃ¶nne. Der Mann Ã¼berlegt und fragt dann, ob er also spÃ¤ter werde eintreten dÃ¼rfen. \"Es ist mÃ¶glich\", sagt der TÃ¼rhÃ¼ter, \"jetzt aber nicht.\" Da das Tor zum Gesetz offensteht wie immer und der TÃ¼rhÃ¼ter beiseite tritt, bÃ¼ckt sich der Mann, um durch das Tor in das Innere zu sehen. Als der TÃ¼rhÃ¼ter das merkt, lacht er und sagt: \"Wenn es dich so lockt, versuche es doch, trotz meines Verbotes hineinzugehen. Merke aber: Ich bin mÃ¤chtig. Und ich bin nur der unterste TÃ¼rhÃ¼ter. Von Saal zu Saal stehn aber TÃ¼rhÃ¼ter, einer mÃ¤chtiger als der andere. Schon den Anblick des dritten kann nicht einmal ich mehr ertragen.\" Solche Schwierigkeiten hat der Mann vom Lande nicht erwartet; das Gesetz soll doch jedem und immer zugÃ¤nglich sein, denkt er, aber als er jetzt den TÃ¼rhÃ¼ter in seinem Pelzmantel genauer ansieht, seine groÃŸe Spitznase, den langen dÃ¼nnen, schwarzen tatarischen Bart, entschlieÃŸt er sich, doch lieber zu warten, bis er die Erlaubnis zum Eintritt bekommt. Der TÃ¼rhÃ¼ter gibt ihm einen Schemel und lÃ¤ÃŸt ihn seitwÃ¤rts von der TÃ¼r sich niedersetzen. Dort sitzt er Tage und Jahre."

        "text": "En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho tiempo que vivÃ­a un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, rocÃ­n flaco y galgo corredor. Una olla de algo mÃ¡s vaca que carnero, salpicÃ³n las mÃ¡s noches, duelos y quebrantos los sÃ¡bados, lantejas los viernes, algÃºn palomino de aÃ±adidura los domingos, consumÃ­an las tres partes de su hacienda. El resto della concluÃ­an sayo de velarte, calzas de velludo para las fiestas, con sus pantuflos de lo mesmo, y los dÃ­as de entresemana se honraba con su vellorÃ­ de lo mÃ¡s fino. TenÃ­a en su casa una ama que pasaba de los cuarenta, y una sobrina que no llegaba a los veinte, y un mozo de campo y plaza, que asÃ­ ensillaba el rocÃ­n como tomaba la podadera. Frisaba la edad de nuestro hidalgo con los cincuenta aÃ±os; era de complexiÃ³n recia, seco de carnes, enjuto de rostro, gran madrugador y amigo de la caza. Quieren decir que tenÃ­a el sobrenombre de Quijada, o Quesada, que en esto hay alguna diferencia en los autores que deste caso escriben; aunque por conjeturas verosÃ­miles se deja entender que se llamaba Quijana. Pero esto importa poco a nuestro cuento: basta que en la narraciÃ³n dÃ©l no se salga un punto de la verdad."

        "text": "A constant force, acting on a particle of mass m, will produce a constant acceleration a. Let us choose the x-axis to be in the common direction of F and a. What is the work done by this force on the particle in causing a displacement x? We have, for constant acceleration, the relations a = ( V - v ) / t and x = Â½ ( V + v ) t. Here v is the particle's speed at t = 0 and V is its speed at time t. The the work done is W = F x = m a x = m ( ( V - v ) / t ) ( Â½ ( V + v ) ) t = Â½ m VÂ² - Â½ m vÂ². We call one-half the product of the mass of a body and the square of its speed the kinetic energy of the body. If we represent kinetic energy by the symbol K, then K = Â½ m vÂ². We may then state the above equation in this way: The work done by the resultant force acting on a particle is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the particle."

World-class companies have recognized that effective leadership and management of people is absolutely critical to achieve the high levels of quality and customer satisfaction they need to compete in today's market. A company's employees are viewed as a valuable source of competitive advantage, and managers assume responsibility for designing optimal structures, systems, and practices.
